A simple helper tool for Genshin Impact that allows you to change the FPS limit, disable fog, change field of view and display current frame rate. **The keybind used to close the menu is INSERT**.

## Usage

1. Download and extract binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/lanylow/genshin-utility/releases).
2. Open CMD as administrator and `cd` into the extracted folder.
3. Now when you're in the folder, run the following command. Replace the `<path>` with location of `GenshinImpact.exe`:
```
loader.exe <path>
```
4. Genshin impact will now be opened and the program will be injected, a menu will pop up where you can configure your settings.

Here is a [video showing the program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia_Q1pS92RI).
