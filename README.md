A simple helper tool for Genshin Impact that allows you to change the FPS limit, disable fog, change field of view and display current frame rate. **The keybind used to close the menu is INSERT**.

## Usage

1. Download and extract binaries from the [latest release](https://github.com/lanylow/genshin-utility/releases).
2. Open `loader.exe` **as administrator**, a window should pop up informing you that it's waiting for the game.
3. Now with that running, open Genshin Impact:
4. The game will open and the mod will be loaded.

Here is a [video showing the program (OUTDATED!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia_Q1pS92RI).
